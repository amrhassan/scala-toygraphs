# scala-toygraphs
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amrhassan/scala-toygraphs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/amrhassan/scala-toygraphs)

Toy (but hopefully correct) implementation of popular graph algorithms in Scala. Do not use in production, it is not
API stable nor it is the most performant implementation out there.
